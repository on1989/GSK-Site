						p Disability benefits may be available to those who purchased disability insurance through work or privately. You may be owed a short and long-term disability benefit in the event of an injury or disability that prevents you from working.
						p You may not want to wait until you are denied a disability claim. Time is of the essence, and ensuring your case is handled properly every step of the way is a priority when your disability claim is at stake.

						p When short-term disability benefits are denied by an insurance company, we can help you understand your insurance benefits and in some cases, we can extend the benefits in ways that are not obvious to you.

						h3 Let us be your voice
						p The pursuit of long-term disabilities is complex and subject to terms, conditions, and the passage of time. Yet, all of your benefits are also subject to interpretation, and experienced lawyers who know disability law will always net more gains and benefits for you than you could command by yourself.
						p GSK team will communicate with the insurance company and fight for your case. We know the language of insurance companies and we know how to fight the ambiguous terms and unclear conclusions they tend to render. We are here to help fight for your money.
						p You may think of GSK team as your personal disability support specialists as we are equipped to handle every facet of your disability case.
